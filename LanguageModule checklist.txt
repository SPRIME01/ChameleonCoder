LanguageModules can implement a lot of different tools to provide language support.
Here's a checklist for inspiration, which might later be used to rate them:

# Compiler
# Execution
# syntax highlighting
# code folding
# auto-indentation of code
# "stub creation" for functions, classes, labels, switchCase, ...
# UI creator etc. (code generators)
# intellisense
# debugging execution
# Localization
# Auto-creation of RichContent from source code or others
